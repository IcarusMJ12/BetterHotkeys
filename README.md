## Better Hotkeys

Tired of stashing your harpoon gun in a cargo scooter by accident while a
mudraptor is eating your face?

This client-only mod changes the behavior of hotkeys and double-clicks to equip
weapons and tools rather than storing them in a held container.  It **will
drop** the held item if it cannot be stored in your inventory or equipped in
the bag slot, so use this at your own risk.

Also, please consider that using this mod may be construed as cheating in a
multiplayer environment.
